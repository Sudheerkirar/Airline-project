**Customer analytics**: Data Analysis and Visualizations using the [Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

## Objective
- **Predict dissatisfaction**: predictive analysis using `sklearn` library.
- **Customers Clustering**: classification analysis using `sklearn` library.

## Workflow
1. Data search, import and setting the libraries `Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` and `SKlearn`.
2. Data cleaning Clean data and prepare for analysis.
3. Data Analysis and Visualization.
5. **Dissatisfaction Prediction Analysis**: dataset preparation, normalization of attributes, one hot encoding, feature selection and applying model.
6. **Customer Clustering**: same steps as before, but with one difference: features transformation with **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. Thus, clustering customers in 5 different customer segments.
